        <p><strong>Vintage style</strong><br>
          <header>Vintage isn’t an established interior design style, but it’s also a look that people want so we include it in our list.

            While they come off as old-fashioned, vintage interior designers have a great aptitude for versatility, creativity, and imagination. They create absolute primary pieces that always tell a story and seem to have a rich history. Vintage interior styling focuses on minimal clutter and puts forth a very clean, crisp, and classy display of furniture, decorative accents, and designs. These interiors also often include old frames and photographs that are usually black and white in order to give the entire space a very old yet stylish look. You may also see a variety of open shelves in most vintage designs that allow one to show off their classic vintage accessories and items.</header>

        <p> <strong>Modern style</strong><br>
          <header>Modern style for interiors is more popular in the media than in real life. I think people appreciate the look of it and it’s definitely cool, but when it comes to living in the more austere design, people opt for warmer home decor styles such as rustic, cottage or traditional.

            Nevertheless, builders and architects are incorporating modern elements to many homes which is kind of cool; but moderating it with materials, angles and lines that add warmth.</header>

        <p> <strong>Minimalist Style</strong><br>
          <header>Minimal interior styles and designs consist of ultra-clean lines and streamlined furnishings that have nothing flamboyant or glitzy about them. They also pick on-air and neutral color palettes that provide a great sense of warmth and coolness to the eyes.

            The minimalist trend is believed to have been started sometime during the twentieth century and was initially influenced by the super simple and delicate Japanese designs. Modern minimalist interior designers always make use of black, white, and primary colors. </header>

        <p> <strong>Classic Style</strong><br>
          <header>Classic interior design can also be called timeless, and some may call it traditional. The look is structured and balanced, rich in accessories, texture and finishes. But don't be put off! There are modern takes on this look that make it perfect for a comfortable and inviting home.
            The classic interior follows simple rules that you can adapt for your own modern take. Start by simply repositioning your furniture – you may be surprised at how simple yet effective this look is for your home. </header>
